# Testing Procedures for Enhanced Trading Bot System

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive testing procedures to verify the 3-10 trades per week constraint and overall system functionality.

## 1. Trade Frequency Constraint Testing

### 1.1 Minimum Trades Test (3 trades/week)
**Objective**: Verify the system increases aggression when under minimum trades

**Test Steps**:
1. Configure bot with `min_trades_per_week: 3, max_trades_per_week: 10`
2. Run backtest with historical data spanning multiple weeks
3. Monitor weekly trade counts in real-time logs
4. Verify aggression multiplier increases (1.3x) when trades < 3 by Thursday

**Expected Results**:
- Weeks with < 3 trades should show aggression increase messages
- Position sizes should be 30% larger when aggression is active
- System should attempt to reach minimum 3 trades per week

**Test Data**:
```json
{
  "test_config": {
    "symbol": "EURUSDm",
    "start_date": "2024-01-01",
    "end_date": "2024-03-31",
    "min_trades_per_week": 3,
    "max_trades_per_week": 10
  }
}
```

### 1.2 Maximum Trades Test (10 trades/week)
**Objective**: Verify the system stops trading when maximum is reached

**Test Steps**:
1. Configure bot with aggressive parameters to encourage frequent trading
2. Monitor for "Maximum weekly trades reached" messages
3. Verify no new trades are opened after reaching 10 trades in a week
4. Confirm trading resumes in the next week

**Expected Results**:
- No trades executed after reaching 10 trades in a week
- Clear log messages indicating trade blocking
- Trading resumes normally in subsequent weeks

### 1.3 Target Range Test (3-10 trades/week)
**Objective**: Verify optimal performance within target range

**Test Steps**:
1. Run extended backtest (6+ months)
2. Calculate percentage of weeks within 3-10 trade range
3. Analyze performance correlation with trade frequency
4. Verify weekly summary reports

**Expected Results**:
- >70% of weeks should be within target range

- All strategy components work together
- News events properly filtered
- Pattern detection influences trade decisions

### 3.2 Error Handling Test
**Test Steps**:
1. Simulate MT5 connection failures
2. Test with invalid trading parameters
3. Cause intentional errors in strategy logic
4. Verify error recovery mechanisms

**Expected Results**:

- Clear error messages in logs
- Automatic recovery where possible
- System stability maintained

### 3.3 Configuration Management Test
**Test Steps**:
1. Test bot startup with various configurations
2. Modify parameters during runtime
3. Verify configuration validation
4. Test parameter persistence

**Expected Results**:
- Invalid configurations rejected with clear messages
- Runtime parameter changes take effect immediately
- Configuration validation prevents invalid states
- Settings persist across restarts

## 4. Backtesting System Testing

    # Test maximum constraint
    engine.trades_this_week = 10
    assert engine.should_decrease_trade_frequency() == True
    
    # Test minimum constraint
    engine.trades_this_week = 1
